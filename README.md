# DjangoToDoList
Project 1 for CS370

Andrew Teng and Melissa Mendoza 

To access our website you must type = dutch.mathcs.emory.edu:8021/home/
Once you arrive to our home page, you log in as a user 
  username: test
  password: 1234
You will then be taken to our todo list where you will see a list of items. 
You can choose to add a task or removing a completed task by clicking on the trash can button. 
Once you are finished you are then able to log out of the list. 

*Note: We branched off of the master and created a different branch named andrew, which is where our functional files are located.
  Our static webpage files from Part A1 of the project are still under the master branch.
